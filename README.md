A randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of traditional physics instruction versus cartoon-enhanced curriculum on student learning outcomes.

## 🔬 Key Finding

**No significant difference** in learning outcomes was found between traditional instruction and cartoon-based physics curriculum:
- Improvement difference: 0.54 points (p=0.77, Cohen's d=0.09)
- Both groups showed substantial learning gains (≈10 points improvement)
- 95% confidence interval for difference: (-3.09, 4.17)

## 🔍 Research Design

### Participants

- Total: 41 secondary education students
- Control group: 21 students (traditional instruction)
- Experimental group: 20 students (cartoon-enhanced instruction)

### Intervention

- Control: Standard physics instruction
- Experimental: Physics instruction integrated with educational cartoons
- Duration: Equivalent instructional time for both groups

### Measures

- Pre-test and post-test physics assessments
- Score improvement (post-test - pre-test)
- Statistical comparison using t-tests, effect sizes, and confidence intervals


## 📈 Key Results

### Learning Improvements

Group|Pre-test Mean|Post-test Mean|Improvement|
--|--|--|--|
Control|3.93 ± 2.13|13.69 ± 6.90|9.76 ± 5.78|
Experimental|3.83 ± 1.74|14.12 ± 6.06|10.30 ± 5.71|

### Statistical Analysis

- Post-test comparison: t = -0.214, p = 0.832
- Improvement comparison: t = -0.300, p = 0.766
- Effect size (improvement): Cohen's d = 0.094 (small)
- Non-parametric test: Mann-Whitney U = 198.0, p = 0.764

## 🎯 Implications

1. **Educational Practice:** Traditional and cartoon-enhanced methods produce equivalent learning outcomes
2. **Resource Allocation:** Questions cost-effectiveness of developing multimedia enhancements for basic physics concepts
3. **Research Direction:** Suggests need to identify specific contexts where multimedia enhancements provide added value
